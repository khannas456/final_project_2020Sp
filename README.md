## **Optimization of Resources for Waste Management**

Spring 2020 [IS 590: Progr Analytics & Data Process]

Monte Carlo Simulation technique will be used to calculate the probability of a bin near an apartment complex being full

### **The Idea behind the project?**

Although the waste generation keeps growing especially in developing nations, the situation is not completely hopeless. 
Thanks to the technology, many forward-looking waste management companies are now installing fill-level sensors in their waste containers to detect a full trash can. 
As a result, the companies are saving money on operational waste collection costs while leaving a lighter ecological footprint.

"People should only buy what they need, otherwise they will only be throwing a lot of it away when it all goes out of date"

### **Project Description**

The project illustrates on optimizing the resources for waste management. Here we create a apartment complex scenario and see how we can increase sanitation and reduce the investment cost by a subtitute of small labor

Hypothesis: If we change from emptying the bins once per week to TWICE per week, we should be able to contain the garbage better (less overflows) even while reducing the NUMBER of bins by 40%
